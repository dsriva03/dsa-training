# LeetCode in Python  

Systematic practice of **Data Structures & Algorithms** in Python, organized by **pattern**.  
This repo serves as both a **training log** and a **reference** for common interview problems.  

---

## Structure
Problems are grouped by category/pattern:  
  - arrays_hashing
  - sliding_window_two_pointers
  - prefix_sum_subarrays
  - binary_search
  - linked_list
  - trees
  - graphs
  - backtracking
  - greedy
  - dynamic_programming
  - stacks_queues
  - design


Each solution file includes:  
- A short problem description  
- Approach + complexity analysis  
- Python solution with comments  

---

## Goals
- Build **pattern mastery** across common interview categories  
- Retain solutions through **spaced review**  
- Maintain a clean, public log for **accountability and signal**  

---

## Practice Method
Every problem is revisited using spaced review:  
- **Day 1:** same-day re-type  
- **Day 3:** quick redo  
- **Day 7:** timed redo  
- **Monthly:** wrap-up exam set  

---

## Environment
- Python 3.9+  
- Run any file with:  

```bash
python problem_name.py
